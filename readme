% given a quaternion [X, Y, Z] from MR3 that we want to be the “zero” orientation
zeroQuat = [-0.4067, -0.5282, -0.4345]
 
% the quaternion helper functions require the format [W X Y Z]
% so we use a helper function calculate W = SQRT(MAX(0,1-(X*X+Y*Y+Z*Z)))
% and build the full quaternion
zeroQuat = q3to4(zeroQuat)
 
% now we need to find the inverse of zeroQuat
calQuat = qinverse(zeroQuat)
 
% now we can transform any further quaternions by calQuat to get a rotation
% from the zero orientation
 
% first let's check that the zero scheme works by applying it to the quaternion we
% used to create it.  we should get the identity quaternion (no rotation)
% [1 0 0 0]
z = qtransform(zeroQuat, calQuat)
 
% now let's apply it to another quaternion that has a small delta from the
% zero orientation
testQuat = [-0.4046             -0.5313  -0.4285]
testQuat = q3to4(testQuat)
 
% apply zero to find delta from zero orientation
zeroedTestQuat = qtransform(testQuat, calQuat)
